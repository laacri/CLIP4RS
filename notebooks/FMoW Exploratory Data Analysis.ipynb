The dataset follows the locations of the fMoW dataset, which are categorized by 62 different types of building/land uses. These images have a 10m spatial resolution, are created from cloud composites over 90 day intervals, and contain one channel for each of the 13 bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance dataset. The dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets according to the original fMoW data splits (metadata is contained in train.csv, val.csv, test_gt.csv), with:\n","- 712,874 training images;\n","- 84,939 validation images;\n","- 84,966 test images.\n","\n","Link: https://purl.stanford.edu/vg497cb6002\n","\n","Paper: SatMAE https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08051\n","\n","Blog: https://sustainlab-group.github.io/SatMAE/"],"metadata":{"id":"JY12FBQl7iQH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Labels\n","\n","To get the labels: fmow dataset (rgb and full): https://github.com/fMoW/dataset\n","\n","Labels: [\"airport\", \"airport_hangar\", \"airport_terminal\", \"amusement_park\", \"aquaculture\", \"archaeological_site\", \"barn\", \"border_checkpoint\", \"burial_site\", \"car_dealership\", \"construction_site\", \"crop_field\", \"dam\", \"debris_or_rubble\", \"educational_institution\", \"electric_substation\", \"factory_or_powerplant\", \"fire_station\", \"flooded_road\", \"fountain\", \"gas_station\", \"golf_course\", \"ground_transportation_station\", \"helipad\", \"hospital\", \"impoverished_settlement\", \"interchange\", \"lake_or_pond\", \"lighthouse\", \"military_facility\", \"multi-unit_residential\", \"nuclear_powerplant\", \"office_building\", \"oil_or_gas_facility\", \"park\", \"parking_lot_or_garage\", \"place_of_worship\", \"police_station\", \"port\", \"prison\", \"race_track\", \"railway_bridge\", \"recreational_facility\", \"road_bridge\", \"runway\", \"shipyard\", \"shopping_mall\", \"single-unit_residential\", \"smokestack\", \"solar_farm\", \"space_facility\", \"stadium\", \"storage_tank\", \"surface_mine\", \"swimming_pool\", \"toll_booth\", \"tower\", \"tunnel_opening\", \"waste_disposal\", \"water_treatment_facility\", \"wind_farm\", \"zoo\"]\n"],"metadata":{"id":"95pgfzK675ep"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Stats\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1syaB4oqfsCF4iLMekmfzIR6YQEr93UuC' width=800>"],"metadata":{"id":"sYGnkwij78NQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lE9h9tn77ei9"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Mount google drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]}]}
